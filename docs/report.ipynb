    "This unsupervised learning method has proven to be effective for audio analysis, especially for source separation and automatic music transcription [1]. To understand why, consider the structure of the recording in ***Figure 1***. Although the recording consists of a single instrument (piano) playing a monophonic melody, the harmonics of each note create replicas of the actual melody at integer multiples of the fundamental frequency. The complexity that arises from mixing multiple intruments or adding any amount of polyphony makes direct analysis of the time-frequency image intractable for most tasks. Nonnegative matrix factorisation allows us to learn the harmonic structure of a mixture of sources, dramatically simplifying analysis."

    "We see that each iteration consists of multiple matrix-matrix multiplications, elementwise multiplication, and elementwise division. As a result, the algorithm is embarrassingly parallel. Furthermore, since each iteration uses the same matricies, the algorithm demands much more computation than memory operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Careful attention should be paid to the order in which the matricies are multiplied. Suppose that $\\bf V$ has dimension $m \\times n$, and that we are interested in approximating $\\bf$ using a dictionary of $k$ components, where $k<m$. Then, $\\bf W$ has size $m \\times k$ and $\\bf H$ has size $k \\times n$. Typically for audio, $m<<n$, since the maximum number of frequency bins is limited by the Gabor limit for a desired time resolution. Choosing an ordering of the matrix-multiplications other than the order in ***Figure 2:*** will result in more work, since $n \\gg k,m$."
