    "Suppose we have a matrix $\\bf V$ containing nonnegative data; for example, the magnitude image of a time-frequency decomosition of an audio recording.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem of nonnegative matrix factorisation (NMF) amounts to factorising $\\bf V$ into two factors $\\bf W$ and $\\bf H$ which are also nonnegative. That is,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\bf V \\approx \\hat {\\bf V} = \\bf W \\bf H$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This technique can be used to learn recurring patterns in the data matrix. In this case, $\\bf W$ represents a learned dictionary and the $\\bf H$ represent represents the decomposition. When applied to the time-frequency decomposition of a music recording, $\\bf W$ contain the learned spectral envelopes of each instrument in the recording and $\\bf H$ contains a transcription of the music.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many variations of NMF algorithms are well-established, and several libraries are available, such as `decomposition.nmf()` in scikit-learn. For the class project, We propose implementing parallel versions of these algorithms:\n",
    "\n",
    "* To learn about NMF algorithms, which are currently an open field of research\n",
    "* To gain experience and intuition for different parallel programming models by implimenting NMF using shared memory, message passing, and GPU programming\n",
    "* To learn about implementation of iterative algorithms with high data parallelism\n",
    "* To improve upon the performance and functionality of existing NMF libraries"

    "The most widely used algorithms for NMF employ a multiplicative weight update method based on the pioneering work of Lee and Sung [1]. The algorithm consists of the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Initialize $\\bf W$ and $\\bf H$ with non-negative values\n",
    "* Iteratively update $\\bf W$ and $\\bf H$ using the following rules: ($n$ is the iteration)\n",

    "As a result, the sequential complexity is $O(n^2m)$, where $n$ will be fixed at 264 and $m$ will scale with the length of the recording."
